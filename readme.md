Those links helped me building this minimalist site:

[jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

[Quickstart](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)

[jekyll on github](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)

[Setting up a GitHub Pages site with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)

for local preview, you may have to constantly battle with 'bundle update/bundle install',
just: 
>bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
